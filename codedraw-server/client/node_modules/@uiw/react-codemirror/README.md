<!--dividing-->

**Features:**

ðŸŒ± Automatically load `mode` files based on configuration.  
ðŸš€ Quickly and easily configure the API.  

## Install

```bash
# Not dependent on uiw.
npm install @uiw/react-codemirror --save
```

## Usage

```jsx
import CodeMirror from '@uiw/react-codemirror';
import 'codemirror/keymap/sublime';
import 'codemirror/theme/monokai.css';

const code = 'const a = 0;';

<CodeMirror
  value={code}
  options={{
    theme: 'monokai',
    keyMap: 'sublime',
    mode: 'jsx',
  }}
/>
```

requiring codemirror resources, This is often the case when specifying certain language modes and themes. Just set the mode, the language resources will automatically lazy loading.

```jsx
import CodeMirror from '@uiw/react-codemirror';
import 'codemirror/addon/display/autorefresh';
import 'codemirror/addon/comment/comment';
import 'codemirror/addon/edit/matchbrackets';
import 'codemirror/keymap/sublime';
import 'codemirror/theme/monokai.css';

const code = 'const a = 0;';

<CodeMirror
  value={code}
  options={{
    theme: 'monokai',
    tabSize: 2,
    keyMap: 'sublime',
    mode: 'jsx',
  }}
/>
```

## Change Theme

```diff
import CodeMirror from '@uiw/react-codemirror';
import 'codemirror/addon/display/autorefresh';
import 'codemirror/addon/comment/comment';
import 'codemirror/addon/edit/matchbrackets';
import 'codemirror/keymap/sublime';
+ import 'codemirror/theme/monokai.css';

const code = 'const a = 0;';

  <CodeMirror
    value={code}
    options={{
+    theme: 'monokai',
      keyMap: 'sublime',
      mode: 'jsx',
    }}
  />
```

## Properties

- `width` width of editor. Defaults to `100%`.
- `height` height of editor. Defaults to `100%`.
- `value` value of the auto created model in the editor.
- `options` refer to [codemirror options](https://codemirror.net/doc/manual.html#config).

The default is false on Windows, and true on other platforms. */

Extra keymaps are found in the keymap directory. See the section on keymaps for more information. */

/** Can be used to specify extra keybindings for the editor, alongside the ones defined by keyMap. Should be either null, or a valid keymap value. */

/** Can be used to add extra gutters (beyond or instead of the line number gutter).
Should be an array of CSS class names, each of which defines a width (and optionally a background),
and which will be used to draw the background of the gutters.
May include the CodeMirror-linenumbers class, in order to explicitly set the position of the line number gutter
(it will default to be to the right of all other gutters). These class names are the keys passed to setGutterMarker. */

/** Determines whether the gutter scrolls along with the content horizontally (false)
or whether it stays fixed during horizontal scrolling (true, the default). */

  * Chooses a scrollbar implementation. The default is "native", showing native scrollbars. The core library also
  * provides the "null" style, which completely hides the scrollbars. Addons can implement additional scrollbar models.
  */

/** boolean|string. This disables editing of the editor content by the user. If the special value "nocursor" is given (instead of simply true), focusing of the editor is also disallowed. */

or it has an autofocus attribute and no other element is focused. */
autofocus?: boolean;

/** Controls whether drag-and - drop is enabled. On by default. */
dragDrop?: boolean;

/** When given , this will be called when the editor is handling a dragenter , dragover , or drop event.
It will be passed the editor instance and the event object as arguments.
The callback can choose to handle the event itself , in which case it should return true to indicate that CodeMirror should not do anything further. */
onDragEvent?: (instance: CodeMirror.Editor, event: Event) => boolean;

/** This provides a rather low - level hook into CodeMirror's key handling.
If provided, this function will be called on every keydown, keyup, and keypress event that CodeMirror captures.
It will be passed two arguments, the editor instance and the key event.
This key event is pretty much the raw key event, except that a stop() method is always added to it.
You could feed it to, for example, jQuery.Event to further normalize it.
This function can inspect the key event, and handle it if it wants to.
It may return true to tell CodeMirror to ignore the event.
Be wary that, on some browsers, stopping a keydown does not stop the keypress from firing, whereas on others it does.
If you respond to an event, you should probably inspect its type property and only do something when it is keydown
(or keypress for actions that need character data). */

For some fonts (and by some tastes) a smaller height (for example 0.85),
which causes the cursor to not reach all the way to the bottom of the line, looks better */
cursorHeight?: number;

/** Highlighting is done by a pseudo background - thread that will work for workTime milliseconds,
and then use timeout to sleep for workDelay milliseconds.
The defaults are 200 and 300, you can change these options to make the highlighting more or less aggressive. */
workTime?: number;

/** See workTime. */
workDelay?: number;

/** Indicates how quickly CodeMirror should poll its input textarea for changes(when focused).
Most input is captured by events, but some things, like IME input on some browsers, don't generate events that allow CodeMirror to properly detect it.
Thus, it polls. Default is 100 milliseconds. */
pollInterval?: number

/** By default, CodeMirror will combine adjacent tokens into a single span if they have the same class.
This will result in a simpler DOM tree, and thus perform better. With some kinds of styling(such as rounded corners),
this will change the way the document looks. You can set this option to false to disable this behavior. */
flattenSpans?: boolean;

/** When highlighting long lines, in order to stay responsive, the editor will give up and simply style
the rest of the line as plain text when it reaches a certain position. The default is 10000.
You can set this to Infinity to turn off this behavior. */
maxHighlightLength?: number;

/** Specifies the amount of lines that are rendered above and below the part of the document that's currently scrolled into view.
This affects the amount of updates needed when scrolling, and the amount of work that such an update does.
You should usually leave it at its default, 10. Can be set to Infinity to make sure the whole document is always rendered,
and thus the browser's text search works on it. This will have bad effects on performance of big documents. */
viewportMargin?: number;

/** Optional lint configuration to be used in conjunction with CodeMirror's linter addon. */
lint?: boolean | LintOptions;
